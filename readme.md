# About
Firstmark is a VC company that publishes a yearly [map](https://mad.firstmark.com/) of "the state of data." This scraper lets you pull their list of companies into a csv.

# Getting Started
Paste this into your terminal: 
```
python3 scraper.py
```
That's it! You could now have a file called output.csv in your project directory!*  

*NOTE: You may have to uncomment the code in scraper.py that writes the output to a csv file.
